Card Matching Game
## Description
Shuffle the cards and lay them out face down in a grid formation.
Players take turns, to the left, turning any two cards picture-side-up. The cards must be turned over completely, so that all players can see them.

The game continues until all cards have been matched and removed from the playing area.

## Game Logic

The logic of this game is to choose two matching cards from an array of cards listed.
The decision of the player are very simple, once player clicks paly, they start clicking trough random cards until two cards are matched. If cards are
not matched the cards will unflip, until it has picked up all choices available. However this game is weighted in a way that determines the 
winning score of indentity, not points.
If the player choose the wrong card, the cards will reset to a standard front image so the can try again.
As they continue along, ech time they find matching cards, the system will block those cards, and wait for the next set of cards.
When all matching cards are abtained, based on the formula designed by the programmer, it will then display results of the players true identity.
There are a total of 8 matched cards.
